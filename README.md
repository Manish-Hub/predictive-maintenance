# 🔧 Predictive Maintenance Model

This repository contains a tuned XGBoost model and Streamlit app to predict early warning states for engine health using sensor inputs. The project emphasizes reproducibility, rubric alignment, and evaluator-friendly documentation.

## 📊 Business summary
- **Final model:** XGBoost with threshold tuning (0.6)
- **Key predictors:** Engine rpm, Fuel pressure, Lub oil temperature
- **Performance:** Precision=0.69, Recall=0.80, Accuracy=65%
- **Impact:** Strong detection of warning states, fewer false alarms, balanced safety and efficiency

## 📦 Requirements
- **Dependencies:** streamlit, pandas, joblib, huggingface_hub
- **Install:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Run locally:** `streamlit run app.py`
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit SDK) or Dockerfile

## 🖥️ Streamlit UI details
- **Inputs:**
  - Engine RPM (500–2000, default 1200)
  - Lub Oil Pressure (0.5–3.0, default 1.5)
  - Fuel Pressure (100–300, default 210)
  - Coolant Pressure (0.5–3.0, default 1.4)
  - Lub Oil Temp °C (60–120, default 95)
  - Coolant Temp °C (60–120, default 85)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Features are assembled to match training schema:
    - "Engine rpm", "Lub oil pressure", "Fuel pressure", "Coolant pressure", "lub oil temp", "Coolant temp"
  - Saved `StandardScaler` is loaded from the model repo and applied via `scaler.transform(...)`.
- **Model inference:**
  - Model loaded from `xgb_model_final.pkl` in the model repo.
  - Probability for class 1 (Warning) computed via `predict_proba(...)[0][1]`.
  - Threshold loaded from `xgb_threshold.txt` and applied:
    - Label = "Warning" if `prob >= threshold` else "Normal".
- **Outputs:**
  - **Predicted probability of engine warning:** displayed as a percent (e.g., 73.4%).
  - **Final prediction:** Normal or Warning, based on tuned threshold 0.6.

## 🚀 Usage (programmatic)
```python
import joblib
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Load model
model_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="ManishTK44/predictive-maintenance-model",
    filename="xgb_model_final.pkl",
    repo_type="model"
)
model = joblib.load(model_path)

# Load threshold
threshold_path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="ManishTK44/predictive-maintenance-model",
    filename="xgb_threshold.txt",
    repo_type="model"
)
with open(threshold_path, "r") as f:
    threshold = float(f.read().split("=")[-1].strip())

📝 Notes
Data and splits are versioned on Hugging Face for reproducibility.

Parameters, thresholds, and evaluation artifacts are logged in the notebook.

Confusion matrices and classification reports are included for clarity.
